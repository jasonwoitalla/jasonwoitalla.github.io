My scene is a 3D zoo that\n        is home to a number of various creatures. These creatures are free\n        models that I found and are linked in my resources section.\n      </p>\n      <Button link=\"https://github.com/jasonwoitalla/csci5611-final-project\">\n        Github Code Link\n      </Button>\n      <Divider />\n      <h2>Overview Video</h2>\n      <p>\n        Here is an overview video I made highlighting the project. It will some\n        of how the project was made, and the different accomplishments found in\n        the project.\n      </p>\n      <div className={styles.mainVideo}>\n        <iframe\n          width=\"560\"\n          height=\"315\"\n          src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvBik2gbE4g\"\n          title=\"YouTube video player\"\n          frameborder=\"0\"\n          allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n          allowfullscreen\n        ></iframe>\n      </div>\n      <h3>The Algorithms</h3>\n      <p>\n        There were several key algorithms that went into this project. The\n        project serves as a host to different algorithms and many more can be\n        implemented in the future. There were a few key ones that were used.\n        BOIDS was the first motion algorithm that I implemented. Currently I\n        only have 2D boids implemented so they can only interact with each other\n        on a flat plane. However, the system is robust enough to support 3D\n        boids in the future.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Another motion algorithm that was implemented was the PRM algorithm.\n        There is a fox located in the zoo that is bounded by a fenced in area.\n        The fox is able to plan motion around the area and avoids all the\n        obstacles in her way. The obstacles could dynamically change, and the\n        algorithm could update itself to plan new paths. It’s a nice robust\n        system and has nice application for baking in motion paths.\n      </p>\n      <div className={styles.center}>\n        <div>\n          <StaticImage\n            src=\"../../images/csci5611/prm.jpg\"\n            alt=\"PRM\"\n            width={600}\n            quality={100}\n          />\n          <p>The fox follows the PRM motion plan.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        The last formal algorithm that was used in the project was TTC. This\n        stands for Time-To-Collision, and it’s an algorithm for moving entities\n        to time when they will have a collision and move out of the way before\n        that happens. This was implemented in the cows, and they can be seen\n        heading towards each other and walk out of the way before any collision\n        happens. The cows are programmed to swap places with each other so if\n        TTC was not used, they would absolutely collide.\n      </p>\n      <div className={styles.center}>\n        <div>\n          <StaticImage\n            src=\"../../images/csci5611/ttc.jpg\"\n            alt=\"TTC\"\n            width={600}\n            quality={100}\n          />\n          <p>Here these cows follow the TTC motion plan.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        The algorithms here definitely have limiting factors. The BOID entities\n        are too independent and don’t share much processing logic. This means\n        that simulation is only able to handle around 40 BOIDS running around. A\n        similar situation is for PRM. The PRM is generated at runtime and\n        creates around 100 game objects into the scene to be used as points.\n        This could be baked into the scene better and prevent the use for\n        different game objects. While the implementation of these algorithms\n        isn’t too efficient, with little optimization effort, much more stable\n        results could be achieved.\n      </p>\n      <div className={styles.center}>\n        <div>\n          <StaticImage\n            src=\"../../images/csci5611/boids.jpg\"\n            alt=\"BOIDS\"\n            width={600}\n            quality={100}\n          />\n          <p>These dinosaur looking creatures follow the rule of BOIDS.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Early Stages</h3>\n      <p>\n        This project had high ambition in its early days. There was to be a much\n        stronger game element where the player would need to inspect and\n        interact with the creatures. However, a lot of time was spent on\n        creating the environment and getting the motion algorithms implemented.\n        Therefore, the game elements of the project had to be omitted. The\n        choice to use the Godot 4.0 engine proved to be a really good one. Areas\n        of the project that I accepted to take a lot longer actually went very\n        fast. I had very few bugs the whole time creating the project and\n        building the 3D environment in Godot was fast and easy. It was\n        challenging getting used to how all the game objects talk to each other\n        and sending messages. I spent a lot of my time on the Godot\n        documentation page trying to figure out different aspects of the engine.\n      </p>\n      <Columns>\n        <div>\n          <StaticImage\n            src=\"../../images/csci5611/sketch.png\"\n            alt=\"First sketch of the project\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            The first sketch of the project was a simple scene with a few\n            animals.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <StaticImage\n            src=\"../../images/csci5611/screenshot.jpg\"\n            alt=\"A screenshot of the early stages of the project\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            A screenshot of the project when I got feedback on it for the first\n            time.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </Columns>\n      <h3>Feedback</h3>\n      <p>\n        Showcasing my project to peers to get feedback was a good experience.\n        From them they told me directions I should go in and gave me some new\n        ideas. I was able to get the ideas of using TTC as feedback from someone\n        that I showed my progress to. I also was told to flesh out my\n        environment more which was good to hear because I wanted my environment\n        to look nice and so did others.\n      </p>\n      <h3>State of the Art</h3>\n      <p>\n        I looked at a number of state-of-the-art motion planning techniques and\n        specifically I looked at boids. Boids is a very old algorithm, so I was\n        curious if there was anything recent research into the algorithm. I\n        found really interesting work in using boids and a neural network to\n        generate art. The boids are able to recreate art with different art\n        styles and of different visual quality. It was very interesting work\n        that I wanted to compare my own implementation of boids.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A common motion planning technique that I did not implement was a\n        navigation mesh. Due to not learning about them in class I didn’t have\n        enough time to look them up on my own, but the Godot engine does use\n        them and they are a quite powerful motion planning tool. Overall, my\n        algorithms are much slower and clunkier than the state-of-the-art, but\n        get the job done and still produce cool looking results.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Future Work</h3>\n      <p>\n        The future work for this project involves adding more creatures and new\n        motion planning techniques. There is a limitless number of creatures\n        that can be added, and it could be very fun to add more exhibits. I\n        would really like to add more gamified elements to the simulation. Some\n        type of checklist for all the creatures inspected and different\n        activates to be done with the creatures. Completing these could reward\n        the player in some way to create a win condition for the game.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I also would like to see the creatures interact with the player in a\n        more interesting way. Currently, there is only basic interaction of the\n        player moving in front of the creatures. However, one idea is to have a\n        dog where the player can throw a ball and the dog will catch it.\n        Finally, I would like to add interaction between the creatures.\n        Different types of creatures should be able to interact with each other\n        in interesting ways.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Resources</h3>\n      <p>\n        This project uses all free and open source tools and resources. Here is\n        how I was able to put everything together.\n      </p>\n      <ul className={styles.list}>\n        <li>\n          Game Engine: <Link to=\"https://godotengine.org/\">Godot 4</Link>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Modeling: <Link to=\"https://www.blender.org/\">Blender</Link>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Models Provided:{\" \"}\n          <Link to=\"https://quaternius.com/index.html\">Quaternius.com</Link>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Tutorials Used:\n          <Link to=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcsIMlet7Fw&t=89s\">\n            Terrain\n          </Link>{\" \"}\n          and{\" \"}\n          <Link to=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjCh2cN3Mfg \">Water</Link>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CSCI5611_Final_Project;\n"],"names":["link","buttonstyle","children","onClick","className","Link","to","icon","faChevronRight","column","container","maxColumns","parseInt","columns","i","contents","j","length","push","React","styles","child","center","pageTitle","active","style","fontWeight","width","height","src","title","frameborder","allow","allowfullscreen","S","alt","quality"],"sourceRoot":""}
