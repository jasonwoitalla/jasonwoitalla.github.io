Using agile with scrum development I was able to complete over 20 stories for the team.  Starting off with accessibility stories, I quickly advanced onto helping the team develop new features and components for the project. A large part of role was coordination with other teams such as design, content, and backend. My three month long internship got extended by a few weeks so I could stay on to help the team, and I gained great technical experience from this role.","job":"Internship Thrivent Financial (Summer 2022)"},{"description":"Worked closely with the professor to develop laboratory activities, and projects. Helped students in office hours learn difficult subjects that were taught in lecture. I gained skills in working with others, leadership and a better understanding of the subject material. The class was CSCI 2021 Machine Architecture and Organization.","job":"Computer Science Teaching Assistant (Spring 2021 - Present)"}],"coursework":[{"class":"CSCI 3081 Program Design and Development","cta":"More details about what I made in this class can be found here","cta_link":"/projects","description":"Worked with the same team all semester to develop one project. The project was written in C++ and it started from scratch. Working with my team using agile, we developed all aspects of drone simulation that would search and rescue a person in need. First, we started with developing the image processing library and then followed it with a kinematics library to enable autonomous movement."},{"class":"CSCI 5551 Intelligent Robotic Systems","cta":"Details about what I made in this class can be found here","cta_link":"/projects","description":"Learned the fundamentals of robotics, forward and inverse kinematics and basic path planning. Using ROS, me in a team of 3 created a final robot project. Our robot navigated a room to approach an object and pick it up using its robotic arm. This class was a mix of theoretical learning and practical implementation."}],"hero":{"buttonText":"View Resume","heroImage":"person-typing","link":"#resume","sub":"Web Developer","title":"Jason Woitalla"}}}]}}}
